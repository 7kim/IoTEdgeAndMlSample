# Machine Learning and IoT Edge

Frequently, IoT applications want to take advantage of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge. In this sample, we walk you through training a machine learning model with data collected from IoT devices in the cloud, deploying that model to IoT Edge, and maintaining and refining the model periodically.
